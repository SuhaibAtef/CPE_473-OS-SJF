# CPE_473-OS-SJF

A project for CPE473 Operating Systems:


implement a simple OS scheduler using C/C++. 
The schedulerâ€™s task is to receive a set of processes and their details, and then decide the order of executing these processes based on the chosen algorithm. Finally, the scheduler will output the order of process execution, in addition to some stats about each of the processes.

The scheduling algorithm chosen for this project will be SJF (Shortest Job First). 

The input will start with an integer N, representing the number of processes, followed by N lines (one for each process). For each line i, the line will start with a string s, representing the process name, followed by 2 numbers representing the arrival time and processing time for the ith process, respectively.
